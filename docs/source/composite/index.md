# Composite

Individual remote sensing images can be affected by noisy data, including clouds, cloud shadows, and haze. To produce cleaner images that can be compared more easily across time, we can create “summary” images or “composites” that combine multiple images into one.

Some methods for generating composites include estimating the `median`, `mean`, `minimum`, or `maximum` pixel values in an image. Care must be taken with these, as they do not necessarily preserve spectral relationships across bands
